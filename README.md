## Install

Install [Minecraft Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/), download the latest stable version of jar file for available Minecraft version. Also install following mods: [McLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mchorses-mclib). Put it in minecraft's `mods` folder, and launch the game.

After that, Emoticons mod should be installed and will appear in Minecraft's mods menu. If Emoticons didn't appear in the mods menu, then something went wrong.

## FAQ

**Q: I don't like Emoticons' animations, but emotes are very cool. Can I disable them?**  
A: You can disable them in McLib's dashboard (Ctrl + 0, check for conflicting keybinds in Options - Controls, if it doesn't work) by enabling **Disable non-emote animations** toggle option.

**Q: Will you downgrade/upgrade mod to other version of Minecraft?**  
A: No. It's gonna stay 1.12.2 (and 1.8.9) only.

**Q: I'm using 1.8.9 version and it says something about "mclib"?**  
A: You need to install [McLib for 1.8.9](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mchorses-mclib/files/3102750) so it would work.

**Q: I'm playing with my friends on the server, and why I can't see them emote, or they can't see me emote?**  
A: In order to see other people emote, the server must also install the mod. No mod on the server, no people emoting.

**Q: Can you add support with mod X?**  
A: No, I won't add support with any other mods.

**Q: Can I add custom emotes myself?**  
A: Yes, watch [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/dhSYT2HEweM) video! Those are not synchronized across clients though. You'll have to manually send these emote files to other people.

**Q: Can you add custom music to emotes?**  
A: No, because I have no time/skill to make cool tunes for every emote, and if I use the original audio that would be illegal. However, you can replace the sounds in Emoticons' jar. Keep in mind that these sounds are going to loop.

**Q: I saw emotes were used in a Minecraft client. Are they allowed?**  
A: Before January 18th, 2022, only [Badlion Client](https://client.badlion.net/), [Lunar Client](https://www.lunarclient.com/), [Crystal Client](https://crystalclient.net/), and a couple of other purchased a license to use my work in their software for profit. Other clients were doing that illegaly (like kraft rise and kristalix clients).

**Q: Can I use this code in my Minecraft client?**  
A: Read the license, and make a conclusion on your own.
